# Fullstack App with Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

## Prisma is a next-generation ORM that can be used to access a database in Node.js and TypeScript applications. In this app, I built a fullstack sample blogging application using the following technologies:

* Next.js as the React framework
* Next.js API routes for server-side API routes as the backend
* Prisma as the ORM for migrations and database access
* Heroku PostgreSQL as the database
* NextAuth.js for authentication via GitHub (OAuth)
* TypeScript as the programming language
* Vercel for deployment

## Overview

The homepage will show posts(feeds) of other users, users can login with their github accounts, users can create draft messages in their account before publishing the drafted message to feeds, users can delete the drafted messages and can also delete published posts.

Took advantage of the flexible rendering capabilities of Next.js by using Static-Site Generation (SSG) with Incremental Static Regeneration. At the end, the app was deployed to Vercel.
